# Stateless Architectures: Games, Exchanges, and E-commerce

## Overview

This document explores the architectural differences between various applications, focusing on the concept of statelessness and its implementation. We'll examine games like Gather Town and PUBG, stateful applications like Chess and Counter-Strike, financial exchanges, and stateless e-commerce systems.

## Stateless vs. Stateful

- **Stateless:** Applications that do not store client session data on the server. Each request is treated as an independent transaction.
- **Stateful:** Applications that maintain client session data on the server, often in memory, to track user interactions and game states.

## Applications

### 1. Gather Town & PUBG (Stateless-like)

- These games emphasize real-time interaction and distributed state management.
- **Architecture:**
  - Client-side rendering and logic.
  - Server-side coordination and data persistence (limited).
  - Minimal server-side state.
  - Real-time communication through WebSockets or similar technologies.
  - Database logging for analytics, not for game state.
- **Statelessness:**
  - They strive for statelessness on the server, relying on client-side state and minimal server-side tracking.
  - The server's main function is to relay information, not to hold the game state.
  - Logging and analytics are the main form of database interaction.
- **Database:** Used primarily for logging and analytics, not for real-time game state.

### 2. Chess & Counter-Strike (Stateful)

- These games require maintaining a persistent game state.
- **Architecture:**
  - Server-side game state management.
  - Real-time updates to clients.
  - Database storage for game history, user profiles, and rankings.
  - In-memory storage is critical for fast interactions.
- **Statefulness:**
  - The server maintains the game state (board positions, player health, etc.) in memory.
  - Database persistence is used for long-term storage and retrieval.
- **Database:** Used for storing game history, user profiles, rankings, and persistent data.
- **In-Memory:** Critical for real-time interactions and game state management.

### 3. Financial Exchanges (Stateful with Stateless Elements)

- Financial exchanges require high-throughput, low-latency processing of transactions.
- **Architecture:**
  - In-memory order books and matching engines for real-time trading.
  - Database storage for transaction history, account balances, and audit trails.
  - Message queues for asynchronous processing.
  - Elements of statelessness can be used for API interactions and some request processing.
- **Statefulness:**
  - Order books and matching engines are inherently stateful.
  - Account balances and transaction histories are persisted in the database.
- **Database:** Crucial for storing financial data, ensuring data integrity, and providing audit trails.
- **In-Memory:** Essential for real-time trade matching and order book management.

### 4. E-commerce (Stateless)

- E-commerce systems emphasize scalability and resilience.
- **Architecture:**
  - Stateless application servers.
  - Database storage for product catalogs, user profiles, and order information.
  - Distributed caching for performance optimization.
  - API gateways for request routing and authentication.
- **Statelessness:**
  - Each request is processed independently, without relying on server-side session state.
  - Session data is stored in client-side tokens or distributed caches.
- **Database:** Stores all persistent data, including user profiles, product catalogs, and order details.
- **Caching:** Used to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed data.

## Key Differences

- **Game State:** Games like Chess and Counter-Strike require server-side state management, while Gather Town and PUBG minimize it.
- **Real-time Interactions:** Games and exchanges prioritize real-time interactions, often using in-memory data structures.
- **Data Persistence:** E-commerce systems and exchanges rely heavily on databases for persistent storage, while some games use them primarily for logging.
- **Scalability:** Stateless architectures, like those used in e-commerce, facilitate horizontal scaling.

## Conclusion

The choice between stateful and stateless architectures depends on the application's requirements. Games and exchanges prioritize real-time interactions and state management, while e-commerce systems emphasize scalability and resilience through statelessness. Understanding these differences is crucial for designing efficient and effective systems.
